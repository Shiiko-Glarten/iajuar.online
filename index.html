  <!-- INTRO ABOVE THE IMAGE -->
  <div id="intro" class="wrap">
    <p>
      I am currently living a nomadic life that grants me the freedom to prioritize creative endeavors.  
      On the horizon over the course of a year is a route through Asia and Eastern Europe, having started 
      in Japan from where I previously lived in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Traveling with my girlfriend, we 
      have already spent time in Tokyo, Taipei, and Hong Kong, currently enjoying Hanoi as we slowly work 
      our way west. We visit locations anywhere from a week to a month at a time with other notable stays 
      in Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Mexico City since the start of 2025. This list of items has accompanied 
      me to each of these locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a small collection of clothing to cover colder temperature ranges that is currently in 
      storage in Minneapolis. This allows me to keep what I carry in my pack minimal as I offload weight here 
      and swap location relevant items in and out of rotation in my kit when returning stateside to visit family.

    <h2><u>Bags</u></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.rei.com/product/rei-trail-25">REI Trail 25: </a> A 25L pack is my ideal size: Small enough to fit as a personal item even on the strictest budget airlines (RyanAir, EasyJet, AirAsia etc), while still large enough to fit ~7 days worth of clothes. Perfect carrying capacity while in transit and plenty inconspicuous enough to use as an EDC upon arrival. The hiking centric design of this pack means little in the way of organization in favor of reducing weight, but this has proven useful in managing budget airline weight restrictions. There are many bucket style, half zip loader backpacks in this category but the features that keep me tied to my Trail 25 are the hip belt, endlessly useful and endlessly stretchy side pockets, and a stowable rain cover. Ive added shock cord to the pack’s exterior for versatility and Nite-Ize locking S-carabiners on the zippers for security.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fjallraven.com/fjallraven-greenland-pocket">Fjallraven Greenland Pocket: </a> Inevitably, there are times when carrying a backpack is overkill. A small crossbody pouch is all that is needed for the essentials - My wallet, notebook/pens, phone, earbuds, and passport all live organized within these pockets. Wise to keep mission critical items out of clothing pockets and behind a zipper for security. This keeps essentials organized and adds modularity. Bonus points for being able to wear this simultaneously with my backpack — hanging forward on my abdomen for easy access to my wallet and passport in airports.</p>
    
    <h2><u>Clothing</u></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men/tops/dry-ex">2x Gray T-Shirts: </a> Synthetic compositions (65poly/35nylon) aren’t usually my first choice (usually favoring natural blends) but in the current peak of southeastern Asia’s summer, nothing else dries quickly enough/wicks sweat efficiently. These are from Uniqlo’s DRY-EX collection - the ubiquity of Uniqlo means these are cheap and easily replaceable if needed. Merino wool is fantastic for odor control but can be delicate and I’m not a fan of babying my clothing. Polyester isn’t fussy in this regard- tough and cheap- so its the tool for the job here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men/shirts">2x Collared Shirts: </a> 50/50 modal/cotton blends in a beige color. Nothing beats the minimalism and utility of a plain old t-shirt but a classier variety is a welcome addition. These were also acquired from Uniqlo and while I was hesitant about the cotton percentage holding onto sweat, Ive found them versatile enough and they’ve earned their stay.</p>

<p><a href="https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/levon-lt-pant">1x Black Pants: </a> While in Tokyo, I recently replaced the pair of Dickie’s 874s that had been traveling with me for a pair of Arc’teryx Levon LT pants. I optimized for weight and packability here because they are often in my pack during the daytime. The 100% nylon composition keeps things light and quick drying while still being plenty tough. These are patterned as a standard 5 pocket jean sans any of Arc’teryx usual branding to keep things low profile; plenty technical without looking like I’m headed on a hike. As far as I can tell - this nylon ‘LT’ variation of the Levon pant can only be purchased in Japan as the US version of the Levon pant is mostly cotton.</p>

<p><a href="https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/gamma-quick-dry-shorts">1x Black Shorts: </a> My most worn item recently here in Asia: These are Arc’teryx Gamma Quick Dry shorts. The 100% nylon material is unbeatable, refusing to hold moisture and have loads of pockets without visually reading as odious cargo shorts. Being fully nylon they do not stretch, making them feel far more robust and secure than a pair of running shorts while adding hardly any more bulk. Each of the 5 pockets (two slash pockets at the waist, two on the thighs, and one on the rear) has a zipper which makes them look slightly more technical than casual but this is bearable for the utility. My only gripe is that these feature an integrated waist belt which, while perfectly functional, deprives me of the option of clipping things to my belt loops (of which there are none) and ability to choose my own belts. These also seem to be an Asia-exclusive for now, but other Gamma model shorts with less pockets seem to be available elsewhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rei.com/product/rei-merino-wool-liner-socks">Socks: </a> I have tried many over the years but return to the functional balance of REI’s merino wool sock liners while traveling. These are marketed as a next to skin layer to wear underneath another more padded pair of socks to protect your feet from blisters and control odor during longer through hikes, however I’ve found that their thinner profile makes them perfect for packability. I bring 3 pairs and usually wear each pair for at least two days before there is any odor no matter how hot and sweaty my feet get. Could probably do with just 2 pairs, but I’m always wearing a pair in transit anyway so 3 pairs it is for now. Durable, as the merino wool’s fragility is strengthened by weaving with nylon, and dry very quickly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men/airism">Underwear: </a> I packed 7x polyester boxers here - A mix of Uniqlo’s classic Airism boxers, and some similar Nike pairs which will eventually be retired and replaced by more Uniqlo pairs. These all pack ultra small and the polyester composition wicks moisture and stops chafing during long haul days. 7 might be excessive but underwear is the one thing I never skimp on, particularly in hot and humid climates. Being stuck wearing dirty undergarments is so uniquely demoralizing that carrying a few extra pairs is well worth its weight in my opinion, especially here in southeast Asia.</p>

<p><a>Belt: </a> Recently, I found a generic nylon belt that features my favorite clasp: the Cobra Buckle. I’ve been enamored by the immensely satisfying mechanics of these parachute style buckles since first interacting with one on a messenger bag I purchased from Waterfield SF. Not quite as aesthetically versatile as a leather belt, but perfect for adventurous contexts with the nylon offering an additional edge over leather when facing wet conditions.</p>

<p><a>Sleepwear: </a> Roughly one fourth of any 24 hours is spent asleep, so I'm willing to justify having one ultralight T-shirt and pair of thin running shorts that only see use for these hours. Comforting, knowing that I always have clean clothes to change into at the end of the day, and hygienic, keeping all the grime of the day out of my bed.</p>
   
    <h2><u>Outerwear</u></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men/jackets/packable">Packable Jacket: </a> On this leg of my travels, the need for jackets and other long sleeves is pretty minimal. It’s too hot and humid here for heavier rain shells or jackets to be desirable when facing the all too frequent precipitation, so that is not currently part of my kit. Instead I opted to just bring a packable windbreaker from Uniqlo. Unbranded as everything they do, and exactly as functional as needed. Recently it has been saving me while I'm working in over-air conditioned cafes. This one features an oversized hood for privacy and takes up minimal space. There is nothing particular about this one from Uniqlo, as there are many similar jackets that serve this function perfectly, but these packable windbreakers have permanently lived in my daily carry packs for about 10 years after I fell in love with their endless functionality on a tour of western Europe.</p>

<p><a>Cap: </a> I rarely go out without a hat. Endlessly thankful to have it when I need it, and takes up practically nothing when I don’t. This one is a no brainer, from fighting the sun and rain to simple bad hair days. This is a light and minimal quick drying hat from a brand of skateboards that I used to ride. Bonus that it can be combined with a bandana to make a makeshift sun cape for my neck.</p>

  <h2><u>Footwear</u></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.merrell.com">Combat Boots: </a> 5 years ago, I stumbled across a pair of mil-spec boots deeply discounted. After lacing them up I realized their potential and they left the store with me that day, becoming a mainstay ever since. The military aesthetics can be a bit much for certain contexts, but their adventure-readiness is unbeatable. My pair is from Merrell - their MQC-2 model. These uniquely forgo the clunkiness associated with boots and feel more akin to a sneaker, remaining quite light while offering all the desirable ankle support of boots. Being a desert boot, these are designed to be breathable in hot conditions which the nylon mesh upper achieves spectacularly. Truly the most comfortable footwear I've ever owned; perfect combination of factors making them tough enough for anything (most recently climbing Mt. Fuji) and comfortable enough to walk 20+ miles while forgetting you’re wearing anything at all. This exact model seems to be discontinued but Merrell currently offers a very similar looking boot.</p>

<p><a href="https://xeroshoes.com/shop/sandals/ztrail-ev-men/">Barefoot Sandals: </a> This is a recent addition to my load out as I'm not typically someone who reaches for sandals at all, but the summer climate in Asia made this option a necessity. I opted for a pair of Xero Z-Trail EV sandals after seeing them at REI. Ive held my interest in the barefoot shoe community at arms length, enticed by all the benefits promised and praises sung by its members, but not entirely motivated to try for myself until now. Initially chosen for their packability, It has been an unexpected delight to try running in these and strengthen some of my previously neglected foot musculature. Bonus points here that they can double as shower shoes very easily, replacing the typical cheap thong style flip flops that have accompanied me on some previous trips.</p>
